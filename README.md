> A command to help automate the clean up and removal of old form submissions.

## What is it?

Form Submissions in Statamic can be stored - which is really handy to allow visibility within the CP, and also can help
with keeping a copy of the submission in case an email is not being sent correctly.

But what happens after a few days... weeks... months... those submissions can start to build up - and that can be quite
a bit of personal information sitting on your server, most likely unnecessarily too.

What would you prefer to do:

- have to remember to manually delete these submissions (and any attachments), or
- have this addon take care of it for you?

This command is designed to be run daily.
